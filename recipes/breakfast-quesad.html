            This would be one of the easiest recipes to make on this page. Its a one pan breakfast that should just take 
            at least 10 minutes to make. The recipe is also flexible to your choice of meat, choice of tortilla, or choice of
            vegetables. You even serve them with Pico de Gallo or Salsa. Traditional sauces like ketchup and mayonnaise can be used also.
            Most of the ingredients are everyday items you have in your house hold. If you don't have some or none of these items 
            go to the grocery store and get them.
